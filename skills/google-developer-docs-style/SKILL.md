# google-developer-docs-style

Apply [Google developer documentation style](https://developers.google.com/style) to technical prose.
This skill distills agent-actionable procedures.
It does not copy the live guide into Git.
Use official URLs as the lookup owner when this skill points you there.

## When to load

Load before writing or editing:

- READMEs, ADRs, and architecture or operator guides
- API, CLI, or product reference pages
- Error messages, UI copy, and in-product help
- Pull request descriptions and release notes aimed at developers

For general prose clarity outside Google documentation conventions, load `writing-clearly-and-concisely` only when a non-Google grammar or rhetoric question remains after applying this skill.

## Scope and overrides

Resolve style in this order:

1. Project-specific style for the repo or product you are documenting.
2. This skill and the official Google guide it summarizes.
3. Third-party references the Google guide names when steps 1 and 2 do not answer the question:
   - Spelling: [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/)
   - Nontechnical style: *The Chicago Manual of Style*, 17th edition
   - Technical style: [Microsoft Writing Style Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/), when its guidance fits your domain

When the Google guide and a project rule conflict, follow the project rule and stay consistent within the document.

This skill does not override Firstmate captain-facing chat rules in `AGENTS.md` section 9.
It does not override Firstmate tracked Markdown repo rules such as one sentence per line, plain dashes, or no agent co-author.
Apply those repo rules to firstmate shared tracked material even when this skill would choose different formatting for product documentation elsewhere.

## Installation

Copy or link this directory into a project worker's skill discovery path:

- `.agents/skills/google-developer-docs-style/` (recommended)
- `.claude/skills/google-developer-docs-style/` (Claude Code)

From the firstmate repository, the source path is `skills/google-developer-docs-style/`.
Installers such as [skills.sh](https://skills.sh) can add the same directory from the published firstmate repo.

## Project AGENTS.md trigger

Add this exact line to the project's always-loaded agent instructions when the project adopts Google developer documentation style:

```md
- `google-developer-docs-style` - load before writing or editing project documentation, READMEs, ADRs, operator guides, error messages, UI copy, or PR descriptions that should follow Google developer documentation style.
```

## Authoritative lookup

Start from these Google guide entry points, then follow cross-references inside the guide:

- [Highlights](https://developers.google.com/style/highlights)
- [Voice and tone](https://developers.google.com/style/tone)
- [Text-formatting summary](https://developers.google.com/style/text-formatting)

Do not scrape or vendor the full guide, the word list, or third-party references into Git.

## Voice and tone

Write like a knowledgeable friend who respects the reader's time.

- Be conversational, friendly, and respectful without slang, zaniness, or hype.
- Prefer clear, direct sentences over formal or flowery phrasing.
- Avoid buzzwords, jargon, clichés, pop-culture references, and culturally specific jokes.
- Avoid "simply", "just", "easy", and "quickly" in procedures.
- Avoid "please" in step-by-step instructions.
- Avoid exclamation marks except where the product truly requires them.
- Do not pre-announce future features in documentation.
- Write for a global audience with varying English proficiency.
- See [Write for a global audience](https://developers.google.com/style/global-communications) and [Write accessible documentation](https://developers.google.com/style/accessibility).

## Person, voice, and sentence shape

- Address the reader as **you**, not **we**, unless **we** clearly means your organization in narrative context.
- Use active voice so the actor is obvious.
- Put conditions, prerequisites, and scope **before** instructions, not after.
- Prefer short sentences; break up dense paragraphs with headings and lists.
- Define acronyms on first use when they are uncommon in the document.

## Headings and titles

- Use sentence case for document titles, section headings, and navigation labels.
- Follow a logical heading hierarchy without skipping levels.
- Make headings descriptive so they make sense out of context.
- Details: [`references/lists-and-headings.md`](references/lists-and-headings.md)

## Lists

- Use numbered lists for sequences, steps, and ordered priorities.
- Use bulleted lists for unordered options, examples, or collections.
- Use description lists for term-and-definition sets or run-in headings with explanations.
- Introduce most lists with a complete sentence, not a fragment completed by the list.
- Keep list items in parallel grammatical form.
- Use serial commas in inline and comma-separated lists.
- Details: [`references/lists-and-headings.md`](references/lists-and-headings.md)

## Text formatting

- Put code, filenames, class and method names, HTTP status codes, console output, and placeholders in code font.
- Put UI element labels in **bold**, not code font.
- Use italics sparingly for introducing terms or semantic emphasis, not for routine stress.
- Reserve underlining for link text.
- Do not override global font, size, or color for decoration.
- Use `and`, not `&`, in headings and body text unless reproducing a UI label that contains `&`.
- Details: [Text-formatting summary](https://developers.google.com/style/text-formatting)

## Dates and times

- Prefer spelled-out dates: `January 19, 2017`.
- Use the 12-hour clock with a space before AM or PM: `3 PM`, `3:45 PM`.
- Avoid ambiguous numeric-only dates such as `04/05/09`.
- When numeric-only dates are required, use ISO 8601: `2017-04-15`.
- Avoid seasons; name months or quarters instead.
- Details: [Dates and times](https://developers.google.com/style/dates-times)

## Links and cross-references

- Use link text that describes the destination, not "click here" or bare URLs in prose.
- Prefer **see** to introduce links and cross-references when it fits naturally.
- Explain unexpected link behavior such as downloads or new tabs.
- Details: [`references/link-and-crossref.md`](references/link-and-crossref.md)

## Accessibility and inclusion

- Write so meaning survives without color, images, punctuation quirks, or directional cues alone.
- Provide alt text for informative images; use empty alt text for decorative images.
- Do not put essential information only in images, tables rendered as images, or icons without labels.
- Avoid directional language such as "above" or "click the icon on the right" when describing UI or document structure.
- Prefer semantic HTML or Markdown structure over visual styling alone.
- Details: [`references/accessibility-and-global.md`](references/accessibility-and-global.md)

## Images

- Provide meaningful alt text that states the image's purpose, not its filename.
- Prefer SVG or high-resolution sources when practical.
- Do not use images of text, code, or terminal output when real text works.
- Details: [Text associated with images](https://developers.google.com/style/alt-text)

## Word list without vendoring

For spelling, capitalization, hyphenation, and preferred product terms, consult the official [word list](https://developers.google.com/style/word-list) at lookup time.
Do not copy the word list into the repo.
Procedure: [`references/word-list-lookup.md`](references/word-list-lookup.md)

## Editorial judgment

This skill states conventions, not a linter.
When a rule would harm clarity for your readers or domain, depart consistently and document the project-specific choice in the project's style owner.
The Google guide itself permits breaking rules when the result is clearer.
